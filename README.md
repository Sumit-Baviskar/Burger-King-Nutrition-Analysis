# **üìå Introduction**  
Fast food has become an integral part of the global food culture, with chains like Burger King leading the charge in offering quick, convenient, and flavorful meals. However, as society becomes more health-conscious, consumers are increasingly seeking ways to make better dietary choices. With growing awareness of the importance of nutrition and its long-term impact on health, people are turning to data-driven insights to make more informed decisions about the food they consume. This shift in consumer behavior is reshaping the food industry, especially among fast food chains like Burger King.

Burger King, a well-established player in the fast-food industry, has witnessed this shift in consumer preferences as more people demand transparency and healthier options on the menu. With the increasing availability of nutritional information, consumers are now empowered to make choices that not only satisfy their taste buds but also align with their health goals. In response, the demand for healthier fast-food options has surged, pushing brands like Burger King to reconsider their menus and offer more balanced meals that cater to health-conscious consumers.

This project aims to analyze the nutritional value of Burger King‚Äôs menu items to uncover key trends, identify the most and least nutritious items, and provide consumers with valuable insights to help them make more balanced dietary choices. By evaluating various nutritional metrics such as calories, fat content, protein, carbohydrates, sodium, and other health-related factors, this analysis seeks to guide consumers towards better food choices while still enjoying their favorite fast-food options.

With increasing emphasis on health and wellness, understanding the nutritional composition of fast food items can help consumers make informed decisions that balance taste and nutrition. By providing data-driven insights, this project not only supports consumers in making healthier choices but also encourages fast food chains to align their offerings with the growing demand for healthier menu options, ultimately contributing to a more health-conscious society.


# **üéØ Purpose of the Project**  
The goal of this project is to perform a **comprehensive data analysis** of **Burger King‚Äôs menu** using **SQL** to extract meaningful insights. 

Specifically, the project aims to:  

‚úÖ Identify **high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sugar** menu items.  
‚úÖ Highlight the **most nutritious options** by considering protein, fiber, and fat content.  
‚úÖ Determine **balanced meal choices** based on macronutrient distribution.  
‚úÖ Analyze **fat-to-calorie and salt-to-fat ratios** to assess overall health impact.

# üéØ **Conclusion** 

Through an in-depth exploration of nutritional data, this project has provided valuable insights into the healthier and unhealthier menu options available. The analysis considered various health-related factors, including dietary fiber, protein content, sodium levels, fat-to-calorie ratios, and overall health scores calculated using a custom formula.One of the key findings was the identification of high dietary fiber items , which play a crucial role in promoting digestive health and maintaining a balanced diet. These items can be strategically marketed as nutritious alternatives for health-conscious customers.

Furthermore, the health score rankings  revealed the best and worst items based on a comprehensive evaluation of their nutritional profiles. This scoring system allowed for a clear comparison of menu items, helping customers make more informed decisions.A major aspect of this study was the balanced meal analysis ‚öñ, which aimed to find menu items with an optimal ratio of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Interestingly, certain beverages, such as unsweetened tea and black coffee, emerged as completely free of calories, fat, and carbohydrates, making them excellent choices for those looking to maintain a zero-calorie intake from beverages.In addition to identifying balanced meal options, the study also focused on high-protein, low-carb choices. These findings are particularly beneficial for individuals following low-carb diets or those looking to increase their protein intake for muscle maintenance and overall satiety.

Another crucial aspect was the sodium content analysis ‚ö°, which highlighted heart-healthy choices by ranking items with the lowest sodium levels. Since excessive sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases, identifying these lower-sodium menu items can help customers make healthier decisions while managing their sodium consumption.
