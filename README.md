# **üìå Introduction**  
Fast food has become an integral part of the global food culture, with chains like Burger King leading the charge in offering quick, convenient, and flavorful meals. However, as society becomes more health-conscious, consumers are increasingly seeking ways to make better dietary choices. With growing awareness of the importance of nutrition and its long-term impact on health, people are turning to data-driven insights to make more informed decisions about the food they consume. This shift in consumer behavior is reshaping the food industry, especially among fast food chains like Burger King.

Burger King, a well-established player in the fast-food industry, has witnessed this shift in consumer preferences as more people demand transparency and healthier options on the menu. With the increasing availability of nutritional information, consumers are now empowered to make choices that not only satisfy their taste buds but also align with their health goals. In response, the demand for healthier fast-food options has surged, pushing brands like Burger King to reconsider their menus and offer more balanced meals that cater to health-conscious consumers.

This project aims to analyze the nutritional value of Burger King‚Äôs menu items to uncover key trends, identify the most and least nutritious items, and provide consumers with valuable insights to help them make more balanced dietary choices. By evaluating various nutritional metrics such as calories, fat content, protein, carbohydrates, sodium, and other health-related factors, this analysis seeks to guide consumers towards better food choices while still enjoying their favorite fast-food options.

With increasing emphasis on health and wellness, understanding the nutritional composition of fast food items can help consumers make informed decisions that balance taste and nutrition. By providing data-driven insights, this project not only supports consumers in making healthier choices but also encourages fast food chains to align their offerings with the growing demand for healthier menu options, ultimately contributing to a more health-conscious society.


# **üéØ Purpose of the Project**  
The goal of this project is to perform a **comprehensive data analysis** of **Burger King‚Äôs menu** using **SQL** to extract meaningful insights. 

Specifically, the project aims to:  

‚úÖ Identify **high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sugar** menu items.  
‚úÖ Highlight the **most nutritious options** by considering protein, fiber, and fat content.  
‚úÖ Determine **balanced meal choices** based on macronutrient distribution.  
‚úÖ Analyze **fat-to-calorie and salt-to-fat ratios** to assess overall health impact.  
‚úÖ Provide insights for consumers, fitness enthusiasts, and health professionals.  



# **üîç Key Problem Statement**  
Fast-food chains offer a wide range of menu items, but **customers often struggle** to differentiate between **healthy and unhealthy choices**. 
The key challenges this project aims to address are:  

‚ùå **Which menu items contribute the most to excessive calorie intake?**  
‚ùå **What are the best high-protein and fiber-rich options for health-conscious individuals?**  
‚ùå **How can consumers find a balanced meal with an optimal ratio of protein, carbs, and fat?**  
‚ùå **What are the least healthy menu items based on calories, fat, and sodium levels?**  

By leveraging **SQL queries**, this project seeks to answer these critical questions, enabling better food choices.

    FROM burger_king_menu
    ORDER BY 'Dietary Fiber (g)' DESC
    LIMIT 10;

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ddda35b-ff98-4fa0-8b7b-f87f615bd97d)

## üìä **Insights :**

- **Chicken category dominates fiber list**:

     - **4 of the top 5** high-fiber items belong to the **"Chicken & More" category**, indicating that breaded or crispy chicken options may contain significant fiber due to the coating or additives.

- **Fiber from sides & breakfast**:

    -  **Onion rings** (large & medium) and **hash browns** add a noticeable amount of fiber, making sides a potential fiber boost for meals.

    -  Breakfast items like the **NY Ultimate Platter** contribute moderate fiber, likely from starchy components like potatoes and biscuits.

# ‚ùì Healthy Index Score (Custom Formula)

    Healthy¬†Index¬†Score = ( Protein + Dietary¬†Fiber ) / ( Calories + Fat + 1 )



 ‚Äã-  Protein and Dietary Fiber contribute positively to the score.

 - Calories and Fat contribute negatively to the score (since they increase the overall health impact).

 - The **"+1" is added to avoid division by zero.**


## ‚å®Ô∏è **SQL Code :**

    SELECT item, 
           (protein_g * 2 + dietary_fiber_g * 1.5 - fat_g - sugars_g) AS health_score 
    FROM burger_king_menu
    ORDER BY health_score DESC
    LIMIT 10;


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32e38c6d-7606-43c2-bfe2-d830e2defca8)


## üìä **Insights :**

- **Salads & Sides Take the Lead**: **3 out of the top 4 items** are salads without dressing, which significantly reduces fat and calories while preserving fiber and protein.

- **Beverage Category Surprise**: **Fat Free Milk** tops the list, showing how a **simple, low-fat dairy drink** offers high protein and calcium with low fat and sugar.

- **Balanced Burger Options Exist**: **Double Hamburger** and **Single Quarter Pound King** rank well due to a relatively better **protein-to-fat ratio** and **moderate calories**, compared to other heavy burgers.

- **Chicken Sandwiches in Moderation**: **Royal Crispy Chicken variants** score high due to their **protein content**, despite being slightly higher in fat.


# ‚ùì Finding the Most Balanced Meal (Equal Fat, Protein, and Carbs)

- **Normalize the Nutrient Differences**: Subtract the values of each nutrient (Fat, Protein, and Carbs) from each other, then take the **absolute value** to find the difference.

- **Calculate the Total Difference**: The sum of the differences will give you a measure of how "unbalanced" the meal is. The smaller the value, the more balanced the meal is.

        Balance¬†Score = | Fat ‚àí Protein | + | Protein - Carbs | + | Carbs  - Fat | 

- **Smaller Balance Score**: The meal with the smallest Balance Score will be the most balanced.


## ‚å®Ô∏è **SQL Code :**

    WITH Balanced AS (
      SELECT 
        item,
        category,
        fat_g,
